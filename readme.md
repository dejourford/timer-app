<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
The purpose of this app is to create a timer that my son can use for his book reading time. I want to make it responsive across all devices so he could even use it on his phone if he wanted to. 

<h1>OBJECTIVES</h1>
--make responsive!!!
<br>
--create function that counts backwards from a value
<br>
--get desired value of time from user
<br>
--display desired time and count down to 0
<br>
--give user option to add 1, 5, or 10 minutes to timer.
<br>
--have a modal that grants access to timer???

<h1>LESSONS LEARNED</h1>
--had to ask chatGPT about making modals
<br>

<br>

<br>
--using arrow functions require a function to literally be called inside of it

<h1>IN PROGRESS</h1>
